- **| CRITICAL |** Compatibility broke for catboost, pyod (other impacts unknown as of now) with sklearn=0.24 (released on Dec 22, 2020). A temporary fix is requiring 0.23.2 specifically in the `requirements.txt`.
<br/><br/><br/>

#### Release: PyCaret 2.2.2 | Release Date: November 25, 2020 (SEVERAL BUGS FIX)
- Fixed an issue with the `optimize_threshold` function the `pycaret.classification` module. It now returns a float instead of an array.
- Fixed issue with the `predict_model` function. It now uses original data frame to append the predictions. As such any extra columns given at the time of inference are not removed when returning the predictions. Instead they are internally ignored at the time of predictions.

### Release: PyCaret 2.2 | Release Date: October 28, 2020

## Summary of Changes

- **Modules Impacted:** `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression` `pycaret.clustering` `pycaret.anomaly` 

- **Separate Train and Test Set:** New parameter `test_data` has been added in the `setup` function of `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. When a DataFrame is passed into the `test_data`, it is used as a holdout set and the `train_size` parameter is ignored. `test_data` must be labeled and the shape of `test_data` must match with the shape of `data`. 
     
- **Disable Default Preprocessing:** A new parameter `preprocess` has been added into the `setup` function. When `preprocess` is set to `False`, no transformations are applied except for `train_test_split` and custom transformations passed in the `custom_pipeline` param.  Data must be ready for modeling (no missing values, no dates, categorical data encoding) when preprocess is set to False.

- **Custom Metrics:** New functions `get_metric`, `add_metric` and `remove_metric` is now added in `pycaret.classification`, `pycaret.regression`, and `pycaret.clustering`, that can be used to add / remove metrics used in model evaluation.

- **Custom Transformations:** A new parameter `custom_pipeline` has been added into the `setup` function. It takes a tuple of `(str, transformer)` or a list of tuples. When passed, it will append the custom transformers in the preprocessing pipeline and are applied on each CV fold separately and on the final fit. All the custom transformations are applied after `train_test_split` and before pycaret's internal transformations. 

- **GPU enabled Training:** To use GPU for training `use_gpu` parameter in the `setup` function can be set to `True` or `force`. When set to True, it will use GPU with algorithms that support it and fall back on CPU for remaining. When set to `force` it will only use GPU-enabled algorithms and raise exceptions if they are unavailable for use. The following algorithms are supported on GPU:

  - Extreme Gradient Boosting `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - LightGBM `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - CatBoost `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - Random Forest `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - K-Nearest Neighbors `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - Support Vector Machine `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - Logistic Regression `pycaret.classification`
  - Ridge Classifier `pycaret.classification`
  - Linear Regression `pycaret.regression`
  - Lasso Regression `pycaret.regression`
  - Ridge Regression `pycaret.regression`
  - Elastic Net (Regression) `pycaret.regression`
  - K-Means `pycaret.clustering`
  - Density-Based Spatial Clustering `pycaret.clustering`

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** New methods for hyperparameter tuning has been added in the `tune_model` function for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. New parameter `search_library` and `search_algorithm` in the `tune_model` function is added. `search_library` can be `scikit-learn`, `scikit-optimize`, `tune-sklearn`, and `optuna`. The `search_algorithm` param can take the following values based on its `search_library`:

  - scikit-learn: `random` `grid`
  - scikit-optimize: `bayesian`
  - tune-sklearn: `random` `grid` `bayesian` `hyperopt` `bohb`
  - optuna: `random` `tpe`

  Except for `scikit-learn`, all the other search libraries are not hard dependencies of pycaret and must be installed separately. 

- **Early Stopping:** Early stopping now supported for hyperparameter tuning. A new parameter `early_stopping` is added in the `tune_model` function for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. It is ignored when `search_library` is ``scikit-learn``, or if the estimator doesn't have a 'partial_fit' attribute. It can be either an object accepted by the search library or one of the following:

  - `asha` for Asynchronous Successive Halving Algorithm
  - `hyperband` for Hyperband
  - `median` for median stopping rule
  - When `False` or `None`, early stopping will not be used.

- **Iterative Imputation:** Iterative imputation type for numeric and categorical missing values is now implemented. New parameters `imputation_type`, `iterative_imptutation_iters`, `categorical_iterative_imputer`, and `numeric_iterative_imputer` added in the `setup` function. Read the blog post for more details: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iterative-imputation-pycaret-22-antoni-baum/?trackingId=Shg1zF%2F%2FR5BE7XFpzfTHkA%3D%3D

- **New Plots:** Following new plots have been added:
  - lift `pycaret.classification`
  - gain `pycaret.classification`
  - tree `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`
  - feature_all `pycaret.classification` `pycaret.regression`

- **CatBoost Compatibility:** `CatBoostClassifier` and `CatBoostRegressor` is now compatible with `plot_model`. It requires `catboost>=0.23.2`. 

- **Log Plots in MLFlow Server:** You can now log any plot in the `MLFlow` tracking server that is available in the `plot_model` function. To log specific plots, pass a list containing plot IDs in the `log_plots` parameter. Check the documentation of the `plot_model` to see all available plots.

- **Data Split Stratification:** A new parameter `data_split_stratify` is added in the `setup` function of `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. It controls stratification during `train_test_split`. When set to True, will stratify by target column. To stratify on any other columns, pass a list of column names.

- **Fold Strategy:** A new parameter `fold_strategy` is added in the `setup` function for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. By default, it is 'stratifiedkfold' for `pycaret.classification` and 'kfold' for `pycaret.regression`. Possible values are:

  - `kfold` for KFold CV;
  - `stratifiedkfold` for Stratified KFold CV;
  - `groupkfold` for Group KFold CV;
  - `timeseries` for TimeSeriesSplit CV; or
  - a custom CV generator object compatible with scikit-learn.

- **Global Fold Parameter:** A new parameter `fold` has been added in the `setup` function for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. It controls the number of folds to be used in cross validation. This is a global setting that can be over-written at function level by using `fold` parameter within each function. Ignored when ``fold_strategy`` is a custom object.

- **Fold Groups:** Optional Group labels when `fold_strategy` is `groupkfold`. It takes an array with shape (n_samples, ) where n_samples is the number of rows in the training dataset. When a string is passed, it is interpreted as the column name in the dataset containing the group label.

- **Transformation Pipeline:** All transformations are now applied after `train_test_split`. 

- **Data Type Handling:** All data types handling internally has been changed from `int64` and `float64` to `int32` and `float32` respectively in order to improve memory usage and performance, as well as for better compatibility with GPU-based algorithms.

- **AutoML Behavior Change:** `automl` function in `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression` is no more re-fitting the model on the entire dataset. As such, if the model needs to be fitted on the entire dataset including the holdout set, `finalize_model` must be explicitly used.

- **Default Tuning Grid:** Default hyperparameter tuning grid for `RandomForest`, `XGBoost`, `CatBoost`, and `LightGBM` has been amended to remove extreme values for `max_depth` and other training intense parameters to speed up the tuning process.

- **Random Forest Default Values:** Default value of `n_estimators` for `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomForestRegressor` has been changed from `10` to `100` to make it consistent with the default behavior of `scikit-learn`.

- **AUC for Multiclass Classification:** AUC for Multiclass target is now available in the metric evaluation. 

- **Google Colab Display:** All output printed on screen (information grid, score grids) is now format compatible with Google Colab resulting in semantic improvements.

- **Sampling Parameter Removed:** `sampling` parameter is now removed from the `setup` function of `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. 

- **Type Hinting:** In order to make both the usage and development easier, type hints have been added to all updated pycaret functions, in accordance with best practices. Users can leverage those by using an IDE with support for type hints.

- **Documentation:** All Modules documentation on the website is now retired. Updated documentation is available here: https://pycaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

#### Release: PyCaret 2.1.2 | Release Date: August 31, 2020 (BUG FIX)
- Post-release `2.1` a bug has been reported preventing `predict_model` function to work in `regression` module in a new notebook session, when `transform_target` was set to `False` during model training. This issue has been fixed in PyCaret release `2.1.2`. To learn more about the issue: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/525
<br/><br/><br/>

#### Release: PyCaret 2.1.1 | Release Date: August 30, 2020 (BUG FIX)
- Post-release `2.1` a bug has been identified in MLFlow back-end. The error is only caused when `log_experiment` in the `setup` function is set to True and is applicable to all the modules. The cause of the error has been identified and an issue is opened with `MLFlow`. The error is caused by `infer_signature` function in `mlflow.sklearn.log_model` and is only raised when there are missing values in the dataset. This issue has been fixed in PyCaret release `2.1.1` by skipping the signature in cases where `MLFlow` raises exception.
<br/><br/><br/>

#### Release: PyCaret 2.1 | Release Date: August 28, 2020
### Summary of Changes

- **Model Deployment** Model deployment support for `gcp` and `azure` has been added in `deploy_model` function for all modules. See `documentation` for details.
- **Compare Models Budget Time** new parameter `budget_time` added in `compare_models` function. To set the upper limit on `compare_models` training time, `budget_time` parameter can be used.
- **Feature Selection** New feature selection method `boruta` has been added for feature selection. By default, `feature_selection_method` parameter in the `setup` function is set to `classic` but can be set to `boruta` for feature selection using boruta algorithm. This change is applicable for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`.
- **Numeric Imputation** New method `zero` has been added in the `numeric_imputation` in the `setup` function. When method is set to `zero`, missing values are replaced with constant 0. Default behavior of `numeric_imputation` is unchanged.
- **Plot Model** New parameter `scale` has been added in `plot_model` for all modules to enable high quality images for research publications.
- **User Defined Loss Function** You can now pass `custom_scorer` for optimizing user defined loss function in `tune_model` for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. You must use `make_scorer` from `sklearn` to create custom loss function that can be passed into `custom_scorer` for the `tune_model` function.
- **Change in Pipeline Behavior** When using `save_model` the `model` object is appended into `Pipeline`, as such the behavior of `Pipeline` and `predict_model` is now changed. Instead of saving a `list`, `save_model` now saves `Pipeline` object where trained model is on last position. The user functionality on front-end for `predict_model` remains same.
- **Compare Models** parameter `blacklist` and `whitelist` is now renamed to  `exclude` and `include` with no change in functionality.
- **Predict Model Labels** The `Label` column returned by `predict_model` function in `pycaret.classification` now returns the original label instead of encoded value. This change is made to make output from `predict_model` more human-readable. A new parameter `encoded_labels` is added, which is `False` by default. When set to `True`, it will return encoded labels.
- **Model Logging** Model persistence in the backend when `log_experiment` is set to `True` is now changed. Instead of using internal `save_model` functionality, it now adopts to `mlflow.sklearn.save_model` to allow the use of Model Registry and `MLFlow` native deployment functionalities.
- **CatBoost Compatibility** `CatBoostClassifier` is now compatible with `blend_models` in `pycaret.classification`. As such `blend_models` without any `estimator_list` will now result in blending total of `15` estimators including `CatBoostClassifier`.
- **Stack Models** `stack_models` in `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression` now adopts to `StackingClassifier()` and `StackingRegressor` from `sklearn`. As such the `stack_models` function now returns `sklearn` object instead of custom `list` in previous versions.
- **Create Stacknet** `create_stacknet` in `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression` is now removed.
- **Tune Model** `tune_model` in `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression` now inherits params from the input `estimator`. As such if you have trained `xgboost`, `lightgbm` or `catboost` on gpu will not inherits training method from `estimator`.
- **Interpret Model** `**kwargs` argument now added in `interpret_model`. 
- **Pandas Categorical Type** All modules are now compatible with `pandas.Categorical` object. Internally they are converted into object and are treated as the same way as `object` or `bool` is treated. 
- **use_gpu** A new parameter added in the `setup` function for `pycaret.classification` and `pycaret.regression`. In `2.1` it was added to prepare for the backend work required to make this change in future releases. As such using `use_gpu` param in `2.1` has no impact.  
- **Unit Tests** Unit testing enhanced. Continious improvement in progress https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/tree/master/pycaret/tests
- **Automated Documentation Added** Automated documentation now added. Documentation on Website will only update for `major` releases 0.X. For all minor monthly releases, documentation will be available on: https://pycaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- **Introduction of GitHub Actions** CI/CD build testing is now moved from `travis-ci` to `github-actions`. `pycaret-nightly` is now being published every 24 hours automatically. 
- **Tutorials** All tutorials are now updated using `pycaret==2.0`. https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/tree/master/tutorials
- **Resources** New resources added under `/pycaret/resources/` https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/tree/master/resources
- **Example Notebook** Many example notebooks added under `/pycaret/examples/` https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/tree/master/examples
