Welcome to pycaret's documentation!
===================================

PyCaret is an open source low-code machine learning library in Python that aims to reduce the hypothesis to insights cycle time in a ML experiment. It enables data scientists to perform end-to-end experiments quickly and efficiently. In comparison with the other open source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to perform complex machine learning tasks with only few lines of code. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, Microsoft LightGBM, spaCy and many more.

The design and simplicity of PyCaret is inspired by the emerging role of citizen data scientists, a term first used by Gartner. Citizen Data Scientists are power users who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more expertise. Seasoned data scientists are often difficult to find and expensive to hire but citizen data scientists can be an effective way to mitigate this gap and address data related challenges in business setting.

PyCaret is simple, easy to use and deployment ready. All the steps performed in a ML experiment can be reproduced using a pipeline that is automatically developed and orchestrated in PyCaret as you progress through the experiment. A pipeline can be saved in a binary file format that is transferable across environments.
