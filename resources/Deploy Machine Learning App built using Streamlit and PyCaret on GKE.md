## RECAP

In our [last post](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-and-deploy-machine-learning-web-app-using-pycaret-and-streamlit-28883a569104) on deploying a machine learning pipeline in the cloud, we demonstrated how to develop a machine learning pipeline in PyCaret and deploy a trained model on Heroku PaaS as a web application built using a Streamlit open-source framework. If you haven‚Äôt heard about PyCaret before, you can read this [announcement](https://towardsdatascience.com/announcing-pycaret-an-open-source-low-code-machine-learning-library-in-python-4a1f1aad8d46) to learn more.

In this tutorial, we will use the same machine learning pipeline and Streamlit app and demonstrate how to containerize and deploy them onto Google Kubernetes Engine.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to build and host a fully functional containerized web app on Google Kubernetes Engine. This web app can be used to generate online predictions (one-by-one) and predictions by batch (by uploading a csv file) using a trained machine learning model. The final app looks like this:

## üíª Toolbox for this tutorial

## PyCaret

[PyCaret](https://www.pycaret.org/) is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that is used to train and deploy machine learning pipelines and models into production. PyCaret can be installed easily using pip.

    pip install **pycaret**

## Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science. Streamlit can be installed easily using pip.

    pip install **streamlit**

## Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail and YouTube. If you do not have an account with GCP, you can sign-up [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started). If you are signing up for the first time you will get free credits for 1 year.

## Let‚Äôs get started.

Before we get into Kubernetes, let‚Äôs understand what a container is and why we would need one?

![[https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/cargo-ship](https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/cargo-ship)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SlzsvRhA71oFOhAjE1Hs0A.jpeg)

Have you ever had the problem where your code works fine on your computer but when a friend tries to run the exact same code, it doesn‚Äôt work? If your friend is repeating the exact same steps, he or she should get the same results, right? The one-word answer to this is ***the environment*. **Your friend‚Äôs environment is different than yours.

What does an environment include? ‚Üí A programing language such as Python and all the libraries and dependencies with the exact versions used when the application was built and tested.

If we can create an environment that we can transfer to other machines (for example: your friend‚Äôs computer or a cloud service provider like Google Cloud Platform), we can reproduce the results anywhere. Hence, ***a ****container ***is a type of software that packages up an application and all its dependencies so the application runs reliably from one computing environment to another.
>  ***What‚Äôs Docker then?***

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*EJx9QN4ENSPKZuz51rC39w.png)

**Docker **is a company that provides software (also called Docker) that allows users to build, run and manage containers. While Docker‚Äôs container are the most common, there are other less famous *alternatives* such as [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) and [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) that also provide container solutions.

Now that you understand containers and docker specifically, let‚Äôs understand what Kubernetes is all about.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system developed by Google back in 2014, for managing containerized applications. In simple words, Kubernetes ****is a system for running and coordinating containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It is a platform designed to completely manage the life cycle of containerized applications.

## Features

‚úîÔ∏è **Load Balancing: **Automatically distributes the load between containers.

‚úîÔ∏è **Scaling: **Automatically scale up or down by adding or removing containers when demand changes such as peak hours, weekends and holidays.

‚úîÔ∏è **Storage: **Keeps storage consistent with multiple instances of an application.

‚úîÔ∏è **Self-healing** Automatically restarts containers that fail and kills containers that don‚Äôt respond to your user-defined health check.

‚úîÔ∏è **Automated Rollouts **you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers and adopt all of their resources to the new container.

## Why do you need Kubernetes if you have Docker?

Imagine a scenario where you have to run multiple docker containers on multiple machines to support an enterprise level ML application with varied workloads during day and night. As simple as it may sound, it is a lot of work to do manually.

You need to start the right containers at the right time, figure out how they can talk to each other, handle storage considerations, and deal with failed containers or hardware. This is the problem Kubernetes is solving by allowing large numbers of containers to work together in harmony, reducing the operational burden.

## What is Google Kubernetes Engine?

Google Kubernetes Engine is an implementation of *Google‚Äôs open source Kubernetes* on Google Cloud Platform. Simple!

Other popular alternatives to GKE are [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) and [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).

## One final time, do you understand this?

* **A Container **is a type of software that packages up an application and all its dependencies so the application runs reliably from one computing environment to another.

* **Docker **is a software used for building and managing containers.

* **Kubernetes **is an open-source system for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment.

* **Google Kubernetes Engine** is an implementation of the open source Kubernetes framework on Google Cloud Platform.

In this tutorial, we will use Google Kubernetes Engine. In order to follow along, you must have a Google Cloud Platform account. [Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started) to sign-up for free.

## Setting the Business Context

An insurance company wants to improve its cash flow forecasting by better predicting patient charges using demographic and basic patient health risk metrics at the time of hospitalization.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qM1HiWZ_uigwdcZ0_ZL6yA.png)

*([data source](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance#insurance.csv))*

## Objective

To build a web application that supports online (one-by-one) as well as batch prediction using trained machine learning model and pipeline.

## Tasks

* Train, validate and develop a machine learning pipeline using PyCaret.

* Build a front-end web application with two functionalities: (i) online prediction and (ii) batch prediction.

* Create a Dockerfile

* Deploy the web app on Google Kubernetes Engine. Once deployed, it will become publicly available and can be accessed via Web URL.

## üëâ Task 1 ‚Äî Model Training and Validation

Training and model validation are performed in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Notebook either on your local machine or on cloud. If you haven‚Äôt used PyCaret before, [click here](https://towardsdatascience.com/announcing-pycaret-an-open-source-low-code-machine-learning-library-in-python-4a1f1aad8d46) to learn more about PyCaret or see [Getting Started Tutorials](https://www.pycaret.org/tutorial) on our [website](https://www.pycaret.org/).

In this tutorial, we have performed two experiments. The first experiment is performed with default preprocessing settings in PyCaret. The second experiment has some additional preprocessing tasks such as **scaling and normalization, automatic feature engineering and binning continuous data into intervals**. See the setup code for the second experiment:

    **# Experiment No. 2**

    from **pycaret.regression** import *****

    r2 = **setup**(data, target = 'charges', session_id = 123,
               normalize = True,
               polynomial_features = True, trigonometry_features = True,
               feature_interaction=True, 
               bin_numeric_features= ['age', 'bmi'])

![Comparison of information grid for both experiments](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*TeqcOM-jBpkdeQu84c4Onw.png)

The magic happens with only a few lines of code. Notice that in **Experiment 2** the transformed dataset has 62 features for training derived from only 6 features in the original dataset. All of the new features are the result of transformations and automatic feature engineering in PyCaret.

![Columns in dataset after transformation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ju5RFYKGkAVEOvVjeoM5nQ.png)

Sample code for model training in PyCaret:

    # Model Training and Validation 
    lr = **create_model**('lr')

![10 Fold cross-validation of Linear Regression Model(s)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2276/1*TX-IzWHBekZBRSQi2T_JTQ.png)

Notice the impact of transformations and automatic feature engineering. The R2 has increased by 10% with very little effort. We can compare the **residual plot** of linear regression model for both experiments and observe the impact of transformations and feature engineering on the **heteroskedasticity **of model.

    # plot residuals of trained model**
    plot_model**(lr, plot = 'residuals')

![Residual Plot of Linear Regression Model(s)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2876/1*LxVMcK4hNvBvEj1tyqxfWQ.png)

Machine learning is an iterative process. The number of iterations and techniques used within are dependent on how critical the task is and what the impact will be if predictions are wrong. The severity and impact of a machine learning model to predict a patient outcome in real-time in the ICU of a hospital is far more than a model built to predict customer churn.

In this tutorial, we have performed only two iterations and the linear regression model from the second experiment will be used for deployment. At this stage, however, the model is still only an object within a Notebook / IDE. To save it as a file that can be transferred to and consumed by other applications, execute the following code:

    # save transformation pipeline and model 
    **save_model**(lr, model_name = 'deployment_28042020')

When you save a model in PyCaret, the entire transformation pipeline based on the configuration defined in the **setup() **function is created. All inter-dependencies are orchestrated automatically. See the pipeline and model stored in the ‚Äòdeployment_28042020‚Äô variable:

![Pipeline created using PyCaret](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NWoHVWJzO7i7gIvrlBnIiQ.png)

We have finished training and model selection. The final machine learning pipeline and linear regression model is now saved as a pickle file (deployment_28042020.pkl) that will be used in a web application to generate predictions on new datapoints.

## üëâ Task 2 ‚Äî Build a front-end web application

Now that our machine learning pipeline and model are ready to start building a front-end web application that can generate predictions on new datapoints. This application will support ‚ÄòOnline‚Äô as well as ‚ÄòBatch‚Äô predictions through a csv file upload. Let‚Äôs breakdown the application code into three main parts:

## Header / Layout

This section imports libraries, loads the trained model and creates a basic layout with a logo on top, a jpg image and a dropdown menu on the sidebar to toggle between ‚ÄòOnline‚Äô and ‚ÄòBatch‚Äô prediction.

![app.py ‚Äî code snippet part 1](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2268/1*xAnCZ1N_BNoPW7FoA-NXrA.png)

## Online Predictions

This section deals with the initial app function, Online one-by-one predictions. We are using streamlit widgets such as *number input, text input, drop down menu and checkbox* to collect the datapoints used to train the model such as Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region.

![app.py ‚Äî code snippet part 2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2408/1*eFeq1wINsUUnvLJfuL-GOA.png)

## Batch Predictions

Predictions by batch is the second layer of the app‚Äôs functionality. The **file_uploader** widget in streamlit is used to upload a csv file and then called the native **predict_model() **function from PyCaret to generate predictions that are displayed using streamlit‚Äôs write() function.

![app.py ‚Äî code snippet part 3](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2410/1*u-g2iLy_gV7hom71PM3CEA.png)

If you remember from Task 1 above we finalized a linear regression model that was trained on 62 features that were extracted from the 6 original features. The front-end of web application has an input form that collects only the six features i.e. age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region.

How do we transform these 6 features of a new data points into the 62 used to train the model? We do not need to worry about this part as PyCaret automatically handles this by orchestrating the transformation pipeline. When you call the predict function on a model trained using PyCaret, all transformations are applied automatically (in sequence) before generating predictions from the trained model.

**Testing App
**One final step before we publish the application on Heroku is to test the web app locally. Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to your project folder and execute the following code:

    **streamlit** run app.py

![Streamlit application testing ‚Äî Online Prediction](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3832/1*GxVKpxijk0tlqk-bO5Q3JQ.png)

![Streamlit application testing ‚Äî Batch Prediction](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3836/1*P5tit2pMf5qiQqU_wjQMVg.png)

Now that we have a fully functional web application, we can start the process of containerizing and deploying the app on Google Kubernetes Engine.

## üëâ Task 3 ‚Äî Create a Dockerfile

To containerize our application for deployment we need a docker image that becomes a container at runtime. A docker image is created using a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is just a file with a set of instructions. The Dockerfile for this project looks like this:

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/49f930956226e898d453265dab390382" frameborder=0></iframe>

The last part of this Dockerfile (starting at line 23) is Streamlit specific and not needed generally. Dockerfile is case-sensitive and must be in the project folder with the other project files.

## üëâ Task 4 ‚Äî Deploy a ML pipeline on GKE:

If you would like to follow along you will have to fork this [repository](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret-streamlit-google) from GitHub.

![[https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret-streamlit-google](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret-streamlit-google)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3816/1*C5WvNEM3U59hHoAjFtE_EQ.png)

Follow through these simple 10 steps to deploy app on GKE Cluster.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create a new project in GCP Console

Sign-in to your GCP console and go to Manage Resources

![Google Cloud Platform Console ‚Üí Manage Resources](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3832/1*OS16COUUns7uBnpyUxH9-w.png)

Click on **Create New Project**

![Google Cloud Platform Console ‚Üí Manage Resources ‚Üí Create New Project](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3814/1*mI3sxfCPrUbt8OtLpa6ViQ.png)

### Step 2 ‚Äî Import Project Code

Click the **Activate Cloud Shell **button at the top right of the console window to open the Cloud Shell.

![Google Cloud Platform (Project Info Page)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3828/1*KSlqCD2VMDvQo4Oft7nqaA.png)

Execute the following code in Cloud Shell to clone the GitHub repository used in this tutorial.

    git clone [https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret-streamlit-google.git](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret-streamlit-google.git)

### Step 3 ‚Äî Set Project ID Environment Variable

Execute the following code to set the PROJECT_ID environment variable.

    export PROJECT_ID=**pycaret-streamlit-gcp**

*pycaret-streamlit-gcp* is the name of the project we chose in step 1 above.

### Step 4 ‚Äî Build the docker image

Build the docker image of the application and tag it for uploading by executing the following code:

    docker build -t gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/insurance-streamlit:v1 .

![Message returned when docker build is successful](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3830/1*5HY6RQRrRzDjsmQEZK_Qbg.png)

You can check the available images by running the following code:

    **docker **images

### Step 5 ‚Äî Upload the container image

 1. Authenticate to [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) (you need to run this only once):

    gcloud auth configure-docker

2. Execute the following code to upload the docker image to Google Container Registry:

    docker push gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/insurance-streamlit:v1

### Step 6 ‚Äî Create Cluster

Now that the container is uploaded, you need a cluster to run the container. A cluster consists of a pool of Compute Engine VM instances, running Kubernetes.

 1. Set your project ID and Compute Engine zone options for the gcloud tool:

    gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID 
    gcloud config set compute/zone **us-central1**

2. Create a cluster by executing the following code:

    gcloud container clusters create **streamlit-cluster** --num-nodes=2

![Google Cloud Platform ‚Üí Kubernetes Engine ‚Üí Clusters](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3832/1*hNX145tbVPjtTFOSLvjXnw.png)

### Step 7 ‚Äî Deploy Application

To deploy and manage applications on a GKE cluster, you must communicate with the Kubernetes cluster management system. Execute the following command to deploy the application:

    kubectl create deployment insurance-streamlit --image=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/insurance-streamlit:v1

### Step 8 ‚Äî Expose your application to the internet

By default, the containers you run on GKE are not accessible from the internet because they do not have external IP addresses. Execute the following code to expose the application to the internet:

    kubectl expose deployment insurance-streamlit --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port **8501**

### Step 9 ‚Äî Check Service

Execute the following code to get the status of the service. **EXTERNAL-IP** is the web address you can use in browser to view the published app.

    kubectl get service

### Step 10 ‚Äî See the app in action on web address

![App Published on [https://34.70.49.248](https://34.70.49.248) ‚Äî Page 1](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3834/1*zHRwykiazKdjL32SE_Uj8g.png)

![App Published on [https://34.70.49.248](https://34.70.49.248) ‚Äî Page 2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3824/1*YhRqNABfQOIcMq2owc0pmw.png)

**Note:** By the time this story is published, the app will be removed from the public address to restrict resource consumption.
